See below for more helpful tips on how to make the most out of your new comic_git site:

* Make sure you read through and understand the [Basic Editing](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/basic-editing/editing-your-website) section of the documentation.
* To make basic changes to the website, like changing colors and fonts, update the `/your_content/themes/default/css/fonts.css` and `your_content/themes/default/css/stylesheet.css` files.
* Once you're comfortable with the basic comic_git usage, make sure to check out [Advanced Editing](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/advanced-editing/advanced-editing-and-the-comic_git-engine) or even [Expert Editing](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/expert-editing/expert-editing)!
* If you want your home page to be your latest comic, [set your Theme](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/advanced-editing/themes#using-existing-themes) to `homepage_is_latest_comic`.
* If you ever have troubles, or your website doesn't build properly, make sure to check out the [Troubleshooting](https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation/additional-information/troubleshooting) page.
