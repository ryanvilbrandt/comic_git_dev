    Anything in brackets that start with an exclamation mark, like this, is called a comment! It will not affect the HTML
    of your page. It's just a note from me to you!
    There's a little extra HTML I've added here to jazz up the front page, but you don't need it! If you just want basic
    HTML with p tags and h1 tags and such, that will also work just fine.

<h1>Congratulations on your new comic_git site! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸ¥³ yahoo</h1>

<!-- The front page uses a responsive 2-column layout. This is done by first defining what content is going to be in
     the column layout, like so. -->
<div class="right-column-layout">
<!-- For this page, I've used a layout where the right column is wider than the left. If you want the left column to be
     wider than the right, change the class to "left-column-layout"! -->

<!-- Next, we separate what we want into the left and right columns. -->
    <div class="left-column">
        <a href="https://comic-git.gitbook.io/documentation">
            <img src="your_content/images/logo.png"
                 alt="comic_git logo: if you can draw it, you can build it!"
                 title="Click here to go to the comic_git help docs!">
        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="right-column">
        <p>This is your home page! It's the main landing page for anyone visiting your website, so make sure it looks good!</p>

        <p>You can change what's on this page by editing the file found at <code>/your_content/home page.txt</code>.
            I've even included comments in that file to help you out, if you're new to HTML.</p>

        <p>You'll probably want to have links like these to your <a href="comic/001/#comic-page">first</a> and
            <a href="latest/#comic-page">last</a> comic pages on your homepage. Or you can use buttons like those below!</p>

        <!-- If you want to make your link look like a button, add class="button" to your 'a' tag like so: -->
        <a class="button" href="comic/001/#comic-page">First Page</a>
        <a class="button" href="latest/#comic-page">Latest Page</a>

        <!--
        If you want to set some information apart, you can set the class as "infobox"! That will put your content in a
        different block of color, which can be defined in stylesheet.css.
        -->
        <p class="infobox">(You will need to manually update the link to your first comic page yourself, but the
            <code>latest</code> page will always point to your newest comic!)</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!-- That's the end of the column layout! Everything below this is just normal HTML. -->
